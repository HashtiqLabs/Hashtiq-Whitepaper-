A High-Performance Layer 1 Blockchain for Real-Time Automation, Trading Intelligence & Creative Infrastructure

Abstract & Introduction
Hashtiq is a high-performance, fixed-supply Layer 1 blockchain built on a custom hybrid consensus mechanism optimized for ultra-fast finality, high throughput, and real-world utility. Powered by the Cosmos SDK and enhanced with modular security and interoperability, Hashtiq introduces native utilities including an autonomous sniper bot framework and a decentralized creative studio — all fueled by a deflationary token model with a fixed supply of 50 million pre-mined tokens.

2. Problem Statement

Hashtiq solves the following core limitations of today’s blockchains:

❌ Slow Finality & Gas Spikes
Hashtiq achieves ~350ms deterministic finality with near-zero fees.

❌ No Native Infrastructure for Sniping or Automation
Hashtiq integrates a native, on-chain sniper execution layer — secure and fast.

❌ Fragmented Creative Tooling
Hashtiq provides a unified AI-powered creative studio for content, NFTs, and campaigns.

❌ Inflationary Tokenomics
Hashtiq uses a fixed, pre-mined supply of 50M with no future minting.

❌ Lack of Interoperability
Hashtiq supports Cosmos IBC, custom prefixing, and future multi-chain rollups.

3. Architecture

3.1 Cosmos SDK Foundation

Hashtiq is built on the Cosmos SDK, offering modular design, deterministic state transitions, and native IBC compatibility. A custom address prefix (e.g., hash1...) ensures identity across the Hashtiq ecosystem.

3.2 Hybrid Quantum Consensus

A novel fusion of consensus protocols:

IBFT – Instant finality (Byzantine Fault Tolerant)

PoS – Secure validator staking

VRF – Random validator selection (anti-MEV)

DPoS – Delegated governance & lightweight voting

Optional DAG Layer – Parallelization for high-volume zones (future upgrade path)

4. Native Sniper Infrastructure

Hashtiq integrates a gas-optimized sniper engine natively into the protocol.

4.1 Core Design

Liquidity Detection Layer – Monitors real-time pool launches

Mempool Scanning Engine – Captures optimal execution points

Auto-Gas Optimization – Dynamic fee strategies

Multi-Chain Bot API – Works across EVM & Hashtiq pairs

Fail-Safe Systems – Stop-loss, take-profit, wallet cycling


4.2 Key Advantages

100% on-chain & decentralized
